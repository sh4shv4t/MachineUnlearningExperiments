# Machine Unlearning Experiments

This repository contains all experiments and code written during my learning journey in machine unlearning. Here you'll find notebooks, scripts, and implementations related to various unlearning techniques, including DeltaGrad and more.

Feel free to explore, run, and modify the code as you learn about machine unlearning!
